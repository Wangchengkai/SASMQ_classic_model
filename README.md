# Time-Indexed MIP Formulation for the SASMQ Problem

This repository provides the implementation of the classic **time-indexed mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation** for the Server Allocation and Scheduling in Multiple Queues (SASMQ) problem.  
The model is constructed to complement the schedule-based formulation proposed in our paper and to further demonstrate why the schedule-based approach is crucial for solving large-scale practical instances.
